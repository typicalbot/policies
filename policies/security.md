The security of your data is important to us. In this Security Policy, we describe how we maintain the security of data.

When we use the terms "Company", "we", "our", or "us" in this document, we are referring to **TypicalBot LLC**. When we use the term "Services" in this document, we mean all products and services created, maintained, and operated by the Company When we use the term "Website" in this document, we mean the Company’s website located at [https://typicalbot.com](https://typicalbot.com).

This policy applies to the Services and the Website.


## (1) Encryption

All of our databases, files, and other storages of content have their files encrypted when they’re backed up or otherwise sitting idle. If someone was somehow able to get a hold of a backup of the database, it’d be useless, because they wouldn’t have the key to decrypt it.

The main database used by the Services also deals with encrypted data while the Services are working.

The Services use TLS encryption when transmitting data. Whenever your data is in transit between you and us, everything is encrypted and sent using HTTPS.


## (2) Monitoring

We have monitoring tools we’ve set up to alert us to any nefarious activity against our domains or servers. To date, we’ve never had a data breach.

We also audit internal data access. If a contractor or employee wrongly accesses data, they will face penalties ranging from termination to prosecution.

If someone malicious does successfully mount an attack against the Services, we will immediately notify anyone affected.


## (3) Redundancy

We use redundancy to ensure high availability and minimize the risk of failure. We mirror backups to multiple storage nodes to mitigate data loss. The networks we use are built in a redundant manner and include links that enable data to take the shortest path and benefit from minimum latency.


## (4) Physical Security

The data center where our servers are located are strictly monitored and under round-the-clock surveillance. Physical activity in the data center is monitored and recorded on secure servers. Only authorized personnel have access to the data center. A surveillance team is on-site at the data center 24/7/365.


## (5) Updated Infrastructure

Our software infrastructure is updated regularly with the latest security patches. The Services and Website run on a network that is carefully monitored.


## (6) Billing Information

All credit card transactions are processed using secure encryption. Card information is transmitted, stored, and processed securely on a PCI-compliant network.
