## 9. Term and Termination

The Terms begins on the date of electronic acceptance or on the date you first access or use the Services and continues so long as you access or use the Services or have an account with us, whichever is longer. You may terminate your agreement with the Company at any time by deactivating and/or deleting your account with the Company and no longer accessing or using the Services.

The Services may link to third party websites, some of which may use materials under license from the Company. We are not responsible for these third party websites or the organizations operating or sponsoring such third party websites, or their products or services, nor do we endorse or support such third party websites, whether or not we are affiliated with such third party websites.

You shall not assign the Terms and any attempted assignment of the Terms by you shall be null and void. The Terms are freely assignable by the Company.

We reserve the right to amend or modify the Terms at any time and for any reason. When we amend the Terms, we will notify you by email prior to such amendments taking effect. The Terms must not be amended by you and any attempted amendment by you will be null and void. Neither the course of conduct between the parties nor trade practice will act to amend the Terms.

## 13. Arbitration

Arbitration or Mediation: You agree that any and all future, past, and present claims or disputes you may have against the Company arising out of, in connection with, or relating to the Terms and the Services (a "Claim") must be resolved by arbitration or mediation. For the avoidance of doubt and clarification, this means that any Claim you have will not be resolved by a judge or jury in a court of law.

Class or Representative Actions: You agree that any Claim you have against the Company must only be resolved on an individual basis and not in a class, consolidated, or representative action or proceeding, regardless of how the Claim is resolved.

Jury Trial Waiver: If, for whatever reason, a court trial should occur, you and the Company hereby irrevocably waive the right to a trial by jury.

Rules of Arbitration: Arbitration shall be conducted by one (1) neutral arbitrator appointed by the American Arbitration Association ("AAA") and in accordance with the Terms and the rules of the AAA ("AAA Rules"). If there is a conflict or inconsistency between the Terms and AAA Rules, the Terms shall govern. The arbitrator shall follow the provisions of the Terms as a court would. The arbitrator may award any damages and relief on an individual basis that a court would award to an individual under the Terms and applicable law. Unless the Company and you agree otherwise, any and all arbitration hearings shall take place in the State of Wisconsin. Any Claim for $1,000 or less shall be conducted solely on the basis of documents submitted to the arbitrator. Any Claim for more than $1,000, but less than $15,000, shall be conducted on the basis of documents submitted to the arbitrator or through a telephonic hearing. Any Claim for more than $15,000 shall be conducted solely by an in-person hearing. Regardless of the manner in which the arbitration is conducted, the arbitrator must issue a reasoned written decision sufficient to explain the essential findings and conclusions on which any award is based. Payment of all administration, arbitrator, and filing fees (collectively, "Arbitration Fees") shall be governed by the AAA Rules, except as otherwise provided in the Terms.

All of the foregoing provisions in this section shall survive any termination of the Terms.

## 14. Indemnification

You must defend, indemnify, and hold harmless the Company, its affiliates and subsidiaries, and their respective agents, contractors, directors, employees, officers, and representatives from and against any and all actions, claims, costs, damages, debts, expenses, fees (including, but not limited to, attorneys’ fees), fines, judgments, liabilities, losses, obligations, and penalties arising out of or in relation to any action, claim, counterclaim, proceeding, or suit arising out of or in relation to:

1. Any Content you post to or with the Services;
2. Your access to, activities on, and usage of the Services;
3. Your breach of the Terms;
4. Your violation of any third party rights, including, but not limited to, any intellectual property, privacy, or publicity rights; or
5. Your violation of any law or regulation.

**Jurisdiction and Venue:** All claims, disputes, litigation, or other legal proceedings arising in connection with the Terms or your use of the Services must be brought and settled in a federal or state court in the State of Wisconsin.

**Severability:** If any provision of the Terms is found and held to be invalid, unenforceable or void, the arbitrator or court shall endeavor to give effect to the parties’ intentions as reflected in the provision, and all other provisions of the Terms will remain in full force and effect.

**Survival:** The provisions of the Terms that by their nature should survive termination will survive any termination of the Terms, including, without limitation, disclaimers, limitations of liability, ownership provisions, warranty disclaimers, and miscellaneous provisions.

**Waivers:** No failure or delay by the Company in exercising any right will waive any further exercise of that right. In addition, no waiver of any breach or default of the Terms will waive any preceding or subsequent breach or default.
