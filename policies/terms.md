## 20) Dispute Resolution

1. **Arbitration or Mediation:** You agree that any and all future, past, and present claims or disputes you may have against the Company arising out of, in connection with, or relating to these Terms of Service, the Services, or your relationship with the Company (a "Claim"), shall be resolved by arbitration or mediation. For the avoidance of doubt and clarification, this means that any Claim you have will not be resolved by a judge or jury in a court of law. For the purposes of these Terms of Service, a Claim shall have the broadest possible meaning and include claims based in common law, contract, fraud, misrepresentation, regulation, statute, tort or any other legal theory.
2. **Class or Representative Actions:** You agree that any Claim you have against the Company shall only be resolved on an individual basis and not on behalf of, or as part of, any purported class, consolidated, or representative action or proceeding, regardless of how the Claim is resolved.
3. **Equitable Relief:** You hereby irrevocably waive your right to seek equitable relief of any kind, including, but not limited to, injunctive relief against the Company and their affiliates, agents, contractors, directors, employees, officers, and representatives.
4. **Trial Waivers:** You hereby irrevocably waive your right to a trial. If, for whatever reason, a trial should occur, you hereby irrevocably waive your right to a trial by jury.
5. **Notice:** You shall provide the Company with written notice of any Claim you have against the Company (a "Claim Notice") prior to initiating any arbitration, mediation, or litigation proceeding. A Claim Notice shall describe the basis and nature of the Claim, describe the specific relief requested, and include the contact information of the party giving notice. A Claim Notice shall be sent to the Company by email to [_claims@typicalbot.com_](mailto:claims@typicalbot.com) and by certified mail to our registered agent at _2800 E. Enterprise Ave, Ste 333, Appleton, WI 54913_. You hereby agree to give the Company a reasonable opportunity to resolve the Claim stated in any Claim Notice. If the Company and you do not resolve the Claim within ninety (90) days after the Claim Notice is received, only then may the Company or you commence an arbitration or mediation proceeding.
6. **Rules of Arbitration:** Arbitration shall be conducted by one (1) neutral arbitrator in accordance with these Terms of Service and the rules of the American Arbitration Association ("AAA"). If there is a conflict or inconsistency between these Terms of Service and the rules of the AAA, these Terms of Service shall govern. The arbitrator shall follow the provisions of these Terms of Service as a court would. The arbitrator may award any damages and relief on an individual basis that a court would award to an individual under these Terms of Service and applicable law. Unless the Company and you agree otherwise, any and all arbitration hearings shall take place in the State of Minnesota. Any Claim for $5,000.00 or less shall be conducted solely on the basis of documents submitted to the arbitrator. Any Claim for more than $5,000.00, but less than $20,000.00, shall be conducted on the basis of documents submitted to the arbitrator or through a telephonic hearing. Any Claim for more than $20,000.00 shall be conducted solely by an in-person hearing. Regardless of the manner in which the arbitration is conducted, the arbitrator must issue a reasoned written decision sufficient to explain the essential findings and conclusions on which any award is based. Payment of all administration, arbitrator, and filing fees shall be governed by the rules of the AAA, except as otherwise provided in these Terms of Service.

All of the foregoing provisions in this section shall survive any termination of these Terms of Service.


## 21) Rights and Remedies

1. The rights granted and obligations made under these Terms of Service are of a unique and irreplaceable nature, the loss of which may result in immediate and irreparable harm to the Company for which remedies at law are inadequate. Therefore, we shall be entitled to seek equitable relief, including injunctive relief, without the obligation to post any bond or surety, in the event of any breach or anticipatory breach by you.
2. We reserve all rights not expressly granted to you herein. The rights and remedies granted to the Company hereunder are cumulative and not exclusive. We reserve the right to object to claims, subpoenas or other demands.


## 22) Miscellaneous Provisions

1. **Electronic Form:** You hereby waive any and all defenses you may have based on the electronic form of these Terms of Service and the lack of signing by the parties hereto to execute these Terms of Service.

7. **Governing Law:** The laws of the United States of America and the State of Wisconsin shall govern these Terms of Service and any claim or dispute of any sort that might arise between us and you, without regard to any choice of law, conflicts of law, or similar principles and without regard to your location.
8. **Jurisdiction and Venue:** All litigation or other legal proceedings resulting from these Terms of Service or the Services shall be brought and settled in a federal or state court in the State of Wisconsin, and you hereby irrevocably agree and consent to the jurisdiction of and venue in those courts and waive any objection as to inconvenient forum and personal jurisdiction.
9. **Severability:** If any provision of these Terms of Service is found or held to be illegal, invalid, unenforceable, or void, the arbitrator or court shall endeavor to give effect to the parties’ intentions as reflected in the provision, and all other provisions of these Terms of Service shall remain in full force and effect.
10. **Survival:** The terms and provisions of these Terms of Service that by their nature should survive termination shall survive any termination of these Terms of Service.
11. **Waivers:** No failure or delay by the Company in exercising any right shall waive any further exercise of that right. In addition, no waiver of any breach or default of these Terms of Service shall waive any preceding or subsequent breach or default.
